    "# Research Question\n",
    "As the project’s data scientist, it is my job to answer the following research question: What is the sentiment of a customer's review?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to classify the sentiment of the following restaurant reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe pizza was disappointing. After a few bites, it left a weird taste in my mouth.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tThe soup is spicy and super flavorful. This is my favorite place to eat!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "This research question will be answered using natural language processing, specifically a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. RNN is a type of neural network capable of performing text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis."
